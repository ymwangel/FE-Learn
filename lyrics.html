  <h2>Sparks Fly</h2>
  <pre>
    The way you move is like a full on rainstrom
    and I'm a house of cards
    You're the kinda reckless that should send me run 
    But I kinda know that I won't get far
    And you stood there in front of me just
    Close enough to touch
    Close enough to hope you couldn't see
    What I was thinking of 

    Drop everything now
    Meet me in the pouring rain
    Kiss me on the sidewalk
    Take away the pain
    Cause I see ,sparks fly whenever you simle

    Get me with those green eyes, baby
    As the lights go down
    Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
    cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile

    My mind forgets to remind me
    You're a bad idea
    You touch me once and it's
    Really something
    you find I'm even better than you imagined I would be 
    I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
    But with you I know it's no good
    And I could wait patiently but
    I really wish you would

    Drop everything now
    Meet me in the pouring rain
    Kiss me on the sidewalk
    Take away the pain
    cause I see , sparks fly whenever you smile
    Get me with those green eyes, baby
    As the lights go down
    give me something that'll haunt me when you are not around
    cause I see , sparks fly whenever you smile

    I run my fingers througn your hair
    And watch the lights go wild
    Just keep on keepin your eyes on me
    It's just wrong enough to make it feel right
    Lead me up the staircase
    Won't you whisper soft and slow

    I'm captivated by you baby
    like a fireworks show
    Drop everything now
    Meet me in the pouring rain
    Kiss me on the sidewalk
    Take away the pain

    Cause I see , sparks fly whenever you smile
    Get me with those green eyes, baby
    As the lights go down
    give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around

    cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile
    oh baby smile
    and the sparks fly
    sparks fly

  <h2>Traveling Light</h2>
  <pre>
    I was doubling over the load on my shoulders
    Was a weight I carried with me everyday
    Crossing miles of frustrations and rivers a raging
    Picking up stones I found along the way
    I staggered and I stumbled down
    Pathways of trouble 
    I was hauling those souvenirs of misery
    And with each step taken my back was breaking
    'Til I found the One who took it all from me
    Down by the riverside
    (Down by the riverside)
    I laid my burdens down
    Now I'm traveling light
    My spirit lifted high
    (I found my feedom now)
    I found my freedom now
    And I'm traveling light
    Through the darkest alleys and loneliest valleys
    I was dragging those heavy chains of doubt and fear
    Then with the one word spoken the locks were broken
    Now He's leading me to places
    Where there are no tears
    Down by the riverside
    (Down by the riverside)
    I laid my burdens down
    Now I'm traveling light
    My spirit lifted high
    (I found my freedom now)
    I found my freedom now
    And I'm traveling light
    My spirit

  <h2>远走高飞</h2>
  <pre>
    我一路看过千山和万水
    我的脚踏遍天南和地北
    日晒或是风吹
    我都无所谓
    路边那朵蔷薇
    鲜红的纯粹
    关掉了手机管他谁是谁
    不要去理会是是与非非
    天亮走到天黑
    从不觉疲惫
    黄昏中的堡垒
    多颓废
    如果迎着风就飞
    俯瞰这世界有多美
    让烦恼都灰飞
    别去理会自我籍慰
    如果还有梦就追
    至少不会遗憾后悔
    迎着光勇敢追，远走高飞
    说走就走一回
    翻过了山坡又踏过水
    跟心走别管东南和西北
    前行还是后退
    靠直觉发挥
    落日下的余晖
    有一点凄美
    拥挤的城市布满了虚伪
    何必去辩解是错或是对
    就让一切回归 童真的滋味
    那自由的感觉 不会累
    如果迎着风就飞
    俯瞰这世界多美
    让烦恼都灰飞
    别去理会自我籍慰
    如果还有梦就追
    至少不会遗憾后悔
    迎着光勇敢追 远走高飞
    说走就走一回
    如果迎着风就飞
    俯瞰这世界多美
    让烦恼都灰飞
    别去理会自我籍慰
    如果还有梦就追
    至少不会遗憾后悔
    迎着光勇敢追 远走高飞
    说走就走一回

    <h2>Welcome to New York - Taylor Swift</h2>
    <pre>
        Walking through a crowd the village is aglow

        Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats

        Everybody here wanted something more

        Searching for a sound we hadn't heard before

        And it said

        Welcome to New York

        It's been waiting for you

        Welcome to New York

        Welcome to New York

        Welcome to New York

        It's been waiting for you

        Welcome to New York

        Welcome to New York

        It's a new soundtrack

        I can dance to this beat (beat)

        Forevermore

        The lights are so bright

        But they never blind me (me)

        Welcome to New York

        It's been waiting for you

        Welcome to New York

        Welcome to New York

        When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors

        Took our broken hearts put them in a drawer

        Everybody here was someone else before

        And you can want who you want

        Boys and boys and girls and girls

        Welcome to New York

        It's been waiting for you

        Welcome to New York

        Welcome to New York

        Welcome to New York

        It's been waiting for you

        Welcome to New York

        Welcome to New York

        It's a new soundtrack

        I can dance to this beat (beat)

        Forevermore

        The lights are so bright

        But they never blind me (me)

        Welcome to New York

        It's been waiting for you

        Welcome to New York

        Welcome to New York

        Like any great love it keeps you guessing

        Like any real love it's ever-changing

        Like any true love it drives you crazy

        But you know you wouldn't change anything anything anything

        Welcome to New York

        It's been waiting for you

        Welcome to New York

        Welcome to New York

        Welcome to New York

        It's been waiting for you

        Welcome to New York

        Welcome to New York

        It's a new soundtrack

        I can dance to this beat

        The lights are so bright

        But they never blind me

        Welcome to New York

        New soundtrack

        It's been waiting for you

        Welcome to New York

        The lights are so bright

        But they never blind me

        Welcome to New York

        So bright

        They never blind me

        Welcome to New York

        Welcome to New York
